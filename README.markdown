This is an abandoned snippet from early 2006, described at [Showing Perfect Time][1], [Showing Perfect Time (Unobtrusively)][2], and the embarrassingly titled [Son of PerfectTime: The Validationator!][3].

Take it, and do with it what you will.  I wouldn't recommend actually _using_ it for a variety of reasons (and I _certainly_ don't claim any ownership or responsibility for the code or it's impact on your life), but the JavaScript isn't complete crap.
